--------

Map updates:

 * Implement point-in-polygon (maybe look for faster lib than leaflet-pip)
 * Change geojson files to be loaded dynamically.
 * Clean up maps.js to support multiple layers and dynamic classification.
 * If a geojson layer config contains "item" it will use that column. Otherwise, points will be classified based on lat/lng.
 * Geojson files are like csv files wrt same origin policy. When URL is remote, we need a proxy. 
 * Re-organize directories such that config.json, data.csv and geojson file(s) are in a single directory.


Wordcloud:

 * Dynamic filtering using regex.
 * Maybe re-implement as native dc.js
 
Generalizing
 
 * Add option for user to change viz configurations
