Map updates:

 * Geojson files are like csv files wrt same origin policy. When URL is remote, we need a proxy. 
 * Re-organize directories such that config.json, data.csv and geojson file(s) are in a single directory.

Generalizing
 
 * Add option for user to change viz configurations
 * Options can either be specified during the construction, or by calling the chain methods
 * The constructor automatically calls chain methods for config options.
 * Each dashboard plugin should at least implement the following methods (perhaps look what dc.js calls them).
   - show (shows entire graph)
   - hide (hides entire graph)
   - refresh (redraws)
   - reset (resets filters)
